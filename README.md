# Data Engineer Path

## What is this?

This repo is basically **my second brain as a Data Engineer.**

It’s **everything I’ve learned so far — written down in text — so future me doesn’t forget how things actually work.**

Not the polished, textbook version.  
The real version.

The stuff you learn by:

- Breaking pipelines  
- Fixing slow queries at 2am  
- Wondering why Spark decided to shuffle 400GB for no reason  
- Forgetting syntax for the 100th time  
- And finally understanding it well enough to explain it simply  

This is where all of that lives.

## Important: This repo is built for Obsidian

This repository is designed to be opened using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

Obsidian turns this from a folder of notes into a **connected knowledge system**.

With Obsidian you get:

- Linked concepts  
- Graph view of ideas  
- Fast navigation  
- Context between topics  

Without Obsidian, you're only seeing half of its value.

Think of this less like files — and more like a **map of how Data Engineering knowledge connects.**

## What’s inside?

Everything that makes a Data Engineer a Data Engineer:

### Core Foundations

- SQL  
- Python  
- Data Modeling  
- Data Warehousing Concepts  

### Big Data & Processing

- Spark  
- PySpark  
- Kafka  

### Pipelines & Orchestration

- Airflow  
- ETL / ELT Patterns  

### Modern Stack

- dbt  
- Docker  

### And the real stuff

- Optimization tips  
- Gotchas  
- Mental models  
- Things that finally "clicked"

## Why this exists

Because Data Engineering is too big to keep in your head.

And because the best engineers don’t memorize everything —  
they build systems to remember for them.

This repo is that system.

## How to use it

1. Install Obsidian  
2. Clone this repo  
3. Open it as an Obsidian vault  
4. Explore, connect, learn  

Or just wander through it when you forget how something works (which will happen).

## Final note

This repo will never be "complete."

Because Data Engineering never is.

It grows as I grow.
